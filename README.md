## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required tools installed. Examples:

- Node.js >= 14.x and npm/yarn (if it's a Node project)
- Python >= 3.8 and pip (if it's a Python project)
- Java >= 11 (if it's a Java project)
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies.

Example (Node.js):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Example (Python):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace the commands above with the ones matching your project.

### Configuration
Explain environment variables and configuration files required to run the project.

Example (.env):
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
PORT=3000
```

Add any migration/setup steps required for the database:
```bash
# Example (Node/TypeORM/Sequelize)
npm run migrate

# Example (Django)
python manage.py migrate
```

### Run Locally
How to start the application locally.

Example (Node):
```bash
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

Example (Python / Django):
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Example (Docker):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:PORT in your browser (replace PORT with actual port).

## Testing
How to run tests and what test frameworks are used.

Example:
```bash
# Node (Jest)
npm test

# Python (pytest)
pytest
```

Explain any additional test setup (e.g., test database).

## Deployment
Brief notes on how to deploy the project (Heroku, Vercel, AWS, Docker, etc.)

Example (Docker):
```bash
docker build -t project_name .
docker run -p 3000:3000 project_name
```

Example (Heroku):
```bash
git push heroku main
```

## Contributing
